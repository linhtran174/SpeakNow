Public transport in Japan is not so 	conevenient and sometimes infrequent so havng a car is the preferred 	choice for getting around, especially if you have to travel to 	various places. I use my car mainly to go from my home to university 	and back. But at the moment I&#x27;m also workig as a part-time intern in 	a local business so I have to go there three afternoons a week as 	well. Trying to do all that by using public trasport would be almost 	impossible and would take a lot more time.<BR><BR>I&#x27;ve had my car 	for about two years now, it&#x27;s a Toyota Prius and I love it. It&#x27;s 	very comfortable and well equipped and it&#x27;s also easy to park and 	economical to run. I can&#x27;t imagine having to do all the things I do 	normally without having my car.<BR><BR>But a few months ago there 	was a problem with it. I noticed a strange noise coming from the 	front of the car one day. At first I ignored it, but then it 	gradually became worse and worse. I told my brother about it and he 	arranged for the car to be inspected by the mechanic. I&#x27;m not a very 	technical person , but apparently there was a problem with the 	suspension and they had to replace a part. That is the only problem 	I&#x27;ve ever had with it. The bad news was that they had to order the 	part specially and I was without my car for about ten days in total. 	It made my daily activities very difficult, and I didn&#x27;t really like 	using the public transport at all. It wasted so much time. <BR><BR>I 	was surprised how quickly I had gotten used to having my car and 	just how convenient it is. I hope that in the future I don&#x27;t have 	any more problems with it. It really is an essential part of my life and I don&#x27;t want to be without it again.<BR></FONT></FONT></FONT><BR><BR> 	</P> </UL>',

We live in a world that functions and centers around technology nowadays and having the latest device allows you to make the most of the advances and developments in the market.

I went with some friends I met here and we spent the weekend there. It&#x27;s the capital, but not of Australia, of New South Wales but it is the most populated city in the country. It&#x27;s located on the south-east coast of the country next to the Tasman Sea. I think the population is something like four and a half million people. It&#x27;s such a famous city and everyone recommended that we go and visit it. <BR><BR>We arived early on Saturday morning and started by taking a stroll around the harbor area. It&#x27;s very interesting and there are lots of ships to see and along the side of the harbor there are lots of restaurants and cafes you can go to.<BR><BR>Then we went on an open-top <A HREF="http://www.sydney.com/things-to-do/tours">bus tour</A> that took us around the city. We saw all the maiin Sydney attractions such as Darling Harbour, Circular Quay, The Rocks, the Opera House, Hyde Park, Kings Cross and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and there was another place but I can&#x27;t remember it&#x27;s name. We did another bus tour on Sunday, but that one took us more out of the city to Bondi Beach and some other places. <BR><BR>I particularly like the variety of things to see and do in and around the city, and the days we were there the weather was just perfect, so we could rally enjoy everthing. I think what impressed me ost was how clean and well kept all the different areas were, and like I said, the variety of activities and attractions. You can find sport, adventure, culture and lots more, and oh yes, the people we met that weekend were very friendly to us.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>',

In the countryside it is mainly agriculture and many younger people prefer to work in other types of job and there are better opportunities in the cities. In general, there are more facilities and more things to do in a city. I think they are more interesting as a place to live. There are many more things to do and people to meet.<BR><BR></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Would you agree that people living in rural areas have fewer problems than people living in cities?</B></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><BR>There is certainly less crime and living in a rural area is more peaceful and safe, but it depends on the types of problems you are talking about. People can get sick in a city or in the country, it&#x27;s the same. People can become depressed or unhappy in both places. Life in the country is maybe simpler than city life and less stressful, but it doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t have problems if you live in a small village in the country - maybe just a different kind of problem. I know of some farmers, friends of one of my uncles, that have some serious problems with their farms.<BR><BR></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Do you think it&#x27;s just as good to live in the suburbs of a city as it is to live in the middle of the city?</B></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><BR>I think both places have some advantages and disadvantages. Living in the city center is very convenient, everything is very close and you can find anything you want within walking distance. Living in the suburbs is maybe better for families because it&#x27;s a little quieter and safer for children but still close to all the facilities of the city.<BR><BR><BR></FONT></FONT></FONT><BR> </P><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>How do you think a town changes and grows to eventually become a city?</B></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><BR>Historically most places grew because of trade and business. Maybe because the town was near the sea or had a railway or something important to make people want to go there. Many of the industrial towns offered jobs for many people so that&#x27;s why their populations grew and they eventually developed into cities. Now, it&#x27;s a little different, as more people are working through technology and are able to work from anywhere and still communicate with people for work and business. Maybe in the future there won&#x27;t be such massive growth of towns like in the past.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>'

I was still standing near the elevators when 	suddenly the doors of one of them opened ... and then that&#x27;s when 	suddently something very funny happened, a woman was coming out of 	the elevator and caught the heel of her shoe in one of the spaces 	between the elevator and the floor, I think her heel broke and she 	awkwardly fell forward towards me ... it was like it was happening 	in slow motion ... and without thinking I put out my arms to catch 	her so she wouldn&#x27;t fall on the floor.

She looked at the 	receptionist, who nodded, and then came towards me. She was smiling 	but I was still feeling nervous ... it was the same woman who I had 	caught as she fell out of the elevator just 20 minutes ago. She 	smiled at me and thanked me again for catching her and we began 	chatting. Then, I didn&#x27;t feel so nervous because at least she 	understood why I looked a little messy. <BR><BR>The best thing about 	the whole incident was ... I got the job.

I was invited by a friend to go rock climbing, well, to be honest it was rock climbing but indoors (at the beginning), not on a mountain. He&#x27;s been doing it for about six months and I had asked him about it once as I was curious how you could climb inside. He tried to explain to me about the &#x27;rock wall&#x27; that they use to practice and it all sounded very interesting. Anyway, I joked with him that I would like to try it someday, but I didn&#x27;t think he took what I said seriously at the time.<BR><BR>So one weekend last month he just called me, on a Friday evening, and asked me what my plans were for the next day. I told him that I hadn&#x27;t planned anything special, but maybe I would go shoppng or meet a girlfriend for lunch or something like that, just to relax. That&#x27;s when he told me that he was going to take me to a rock climbing center here in the city and show me what it was all about. I&#x27;d forgotten all about our conversation until he invited me to go with him.<BR><BR>It was great fun, although I was a little scared at first, apprehensive really more than scared, as the instructor was very good and I started practising on the ground and very low on the wall to gain my confidence so there was very little risk. After training with the instructor for a few hours and learning all about the safety aspects and the basic techniques used in climbing I thought that that was the end of the activity. But my friend had arranged for us to visit a place just outside of town where we could actually climb on real rocks for practice. <BR><BR>It was a beautiful day and after practising on the indoor wall I really wanted to try and do it on some real rocks, so off we went. When we arrived, there were quite a few people climbing already. My friend helped me to get started and accompanied me all the time, he was really very patient, and when I thought I was stuck at one point he showed me how I could overcome the problem and continue.<BR><BR>I have to admit that it was a great day, something new and exciting that I&#x27;d never done before. I really liked it and I think I want to try it again soon. I&#x27;ll probably have to try and improve my level of fitness because it seems to be quite demanding physically, but hey, that&#x27;s a good reason to get toned and fit which is a good thing. I have another friend who loves doing physical exer cise so I&#x27;ll probably recommend it to her also. </FONT></FONT></FONT> </P>',

I think if you buy some of the special equipment then it could be quite expensive, but then you&#x27;ll probably use it for a long time so it&#x27;s good value for money. I suppose if you were really serious about it you could spend more money on travelling to climb in different places, that might be more expensive than any equipment you buy.<BR><BR></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Do you generally like trying new things?</B></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><BR>Yes, but I&#x27;m really not the adventure type - I don&#x27;t go for all the adrenalin or extreme sports. The only reason I tried rock climbing was because my friend invited me to go with him. If he hadn&#x27;t, I probably would&#x27;ve never gotten round to doing it on my own.<BR><BR></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Would you do the same activity again in the future?</B></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><BR>Yes, I probably will - I really enjoyed myself and it seems like a great way to stay fit and enjoy the good weather outdoors at the same time. It&#x27;s quite relaxing too because you have to concentrate on what you&#x27;re doing so you forget about everything else that might be bothering you in life, it&#x27;s a bit like therapy, and when you finish you feel a little tired but very satisfied.<BR><BR></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Do people in your country usually do this type of activity?</B></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><BR>In my country it&#x27;s not as popular as it is here. We have many mountains and there have always been climbers but here it seems to be a really popular activity, especially with young people.<BR><BR></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>How do you think people should be encouraged to do more outdoor activities?</B></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><BR>I don&#x27;t know if they should be encouraged on purpose. It&#x27;s a matter of personal choice. Some people just don&#x27;t like being outside in the country or doing this kind of activity so there&#x27;s little point in tryin to encourage them to do something they aren&#x27;t interested in. It&#x27;s nice if they are aware of the opportunity to try it - but if they don&#x27;t want to then ok.<BR><BR></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>What do you consider to be the main disadvantage of such activities?</B></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><BR>Personally, I don&#x27;t think there are any disadvantages, except it might cost you some money. Most outdoor activities are healthy and many such as cycling or even just walking do not require you to be super athletic or anythig like that, you can just enjoy being outside in the fresh air if you like that kind of thing. I think there are many more advantages than disadvantagse associated with outdoor activites.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>'
